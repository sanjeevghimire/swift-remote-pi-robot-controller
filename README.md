# Full Stack Development using IBM Kitura
We will be creating a Remote for a Robot powered by Raspberry PI and using server-side Kitura as a middle ware. The Robot will also be integrated with Watson Text-To-Speech services. The remote will be able to control the robot for two things:
* Enter a text for the robot to speak out
* Choose a color for the robot to blink
